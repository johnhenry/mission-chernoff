# Mission Possible : Chernoff Object

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a simple Chernoff Object Component
based on a [Chernoff Face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_face).

In the **app/** directory, you'll find a ready-made Chernoff Face.

Edit the code in **app/component.mjs** and change the code to draw something other than a face based on given parameters.

Edit the code in **app/index.mjs** and **app/graph.mjs** to show it off!

## Getting Started

From within this repository:

Install with: 

```bash
npm install
```

Serve application in **app/** folder with:

```bash
npm start
```

## Drawing

### Tutorials
The face is draw using SVG.

There are a number of good tutorials on the internet for using SVG including the ones [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial).

(The one on [paths](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths) was useful when creating this tutorial.)

### Applications
If you don't fancy drawing using code... Too bad!

However, some applications allow one to create art and export it to SVG.

You can use applications [like](https://inkscape.org/) as a starting point.
